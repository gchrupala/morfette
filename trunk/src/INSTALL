BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================
Currently the build process is pretty rough and is unlikely to work smoothly
on systems other than Linux.

- Download, build and install the Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit, available at
  http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0450736/maxent_toolkit.html
  You need the library (libmaxent.a) and the header files.
- If you don't already have it, install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler available at
  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
- Install additional Haskell libraries: multiset, utf8-string, bytestring, 
  binary-strict and binary. They are all available from 
  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html
- Configure and build Morfette:
  You will need to change the settings in morfette-exe.buildinfo to where you 
  installed the maxent library and headers. You may also need to adjust the 
  extra-libraries field in morfette-exe.cabal, depending on the version of your 
  Fortran compiler and libraries. Once you've done that, it's simple:

  > runghc Setup configure --prefix=path/to/install-dir
  > runghc Setup build
  > runghc Setup install
